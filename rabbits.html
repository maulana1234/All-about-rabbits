        <p> Little bunny Foo Foo
        Hopping through the forest
        Scooping up the field mice
        And bopping them on the head
        Down came the good fairy,and she said 
        "Little bunny Foo Foo
        I don't want to see you
        Scooping up the field mice
        And bopping them on the head."</p>

Scooping up the field mice 
And bopping them on the head 
Down came the Good Fairy, and she said 
"Little bunny Foo Foo 
I don't want to see you 
Scooping up the field mice 
And bopping them on the head."
